# UPDATE BY A STUDENT
# Up-to-date Gradle version was 7.0.2 in 2017 but it needs to be updated in 7.07.2023, otherwise it won't run with your up-to-date java version.
# I tried 8.2 Gradle but it didn't work however 7.6.2 Gradle works fine and also supports Java 17.
# Check for your versions: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html
